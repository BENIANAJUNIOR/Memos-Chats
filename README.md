# Memos Chats

## Objective

To develop a peer-to-peer video call application with a seamless lobby system that allows users to join a room and invite others without requiring a room ID. The application will provide essential video calling features, including mic muting, camera toggling, screen sharing, and real-time chat.
A key focus is to create an engaging user experience inspired by Discord and Twitter Spaces, where participants appear in circular frames. Users can click to focus on a participant or switch back to group view. Additionally, the app will display participant names and a welcome message upon joining.
This project aims to deliver a modern, interactive, and user-friendly video calling platform with full communication control.
